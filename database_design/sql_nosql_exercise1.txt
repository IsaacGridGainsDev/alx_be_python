A use case where a SQL database would be more suitable than a NoSQL database. and my reasoning

A multi-year architectural research study tracing the performance of sustainable building materials across multiple test-sites.
Why SQL?
1. Relational complexity: Each material has multiple tests across multiple sites, under varying conditions; Each test is linked to specific researchers, dates and methodologies; Being able to answer questions such as "For {materials} tested in {climatic condition} climates by {Researcher}, what was the average {datapoint} retention after {time/date}"

2. Data Integrity: Ensuring that every datapoint links to the correct source, researcher and methodology; SQL's foreign keys, and other features guarantee consistency

3. Standardized schema over time: Field definitions are unlikely to change often, a direct benefit of SQL's strict schema and query power.

However, this only works to answer emprical questions with specific logical outputs not subject to time. If the questions asked are "What is the latest infomation on X site from the last 5 minutes" it becomes a NoSQL solution.
